# Reflections on Water: A Data Story of Quality and Ecology in Prince Albert’s Lakes


Welcome to the "Reflections on Water" data story repository. This project delves into the intricate narratives of water quality and ecological health in Kingsmere and Waskesiu lakes, nestled in the pristine landscapes of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Canada. Through data analysis and visualization, we explore the relationships, patterns, and insights hidden within the depths of these aquatic ecosystems.

## Introduction

Water, often referred to as the lifeblood of our planet, carries within its currents intricate tales of ecological, chemical, and biological interactions. This data-driven narrative aims to elucidate these silent stories, focusing on the water quality and ecological health of Kingsmere and Waskesiu lakes.

## Guiding Questions

In this data story, we address the following guiding questions:

1. How do interactions between chemical attributes in water samples influence overall water quality in aquatic ecosystems?
2. How does the Secchi depth change with seasons, and what does it tell us about variations in lake water transparency?
3. What patterns of change have been observed in the temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen levels in the lake over time?
4. How do the total coliform concentrations contrast between Kingsmere and Waskesiu lakes?
5. How do contamination levels in the lake vary across different months, and what environmental factors might be contributing to these changes?

## Tools Used

We predominantly employed Python and R for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis. For visualization, tools such as Tableau, seaborn, matplotlib, and ggplot2 were utilized to convert complex data into easily comprehensible insights and visually compelling narratives.

## Data Source

The data utilized in this project is sourced from the "Water Quality — Prince Albert" dataset, published by the Government of Canada in 2023. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of the water quality in Kingsmere and Waskesiu lakes, encompassing diverse variables from water chemistry to discharge measurements.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the analysis, visualizations, and insights presented in this data story. If you have any questions, suggestions, or collaborations, please don't hesitate to reach out.
